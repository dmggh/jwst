# This is a config file for developers running pyetc.
#
# If you do not create config.py yourself, the install script will copy
# this file and use it.
#
# If you want to modify these settings for your own use, copy this
# file to config.py and edit it, then run the install script at the
# top level of the source tree.

#
# This config attempts to determine as much as possible automatically.
# For production use, you would use static assignements for everything.
#
# Some of this config is used at install time and some is used at run
# time.  Installing is easy enough that you can just install again if
# you change anything.

# servertype is what type of web server the install script should

#
#   django
#       configure to use the django development server - works anywhere
#
#   mod_python
#       configure to use apache with mod_python - works on etc-dev1 or
#       anywhere that we have the *correct* mod_python available
#
#   wsgi
#       configure to use apache with wsgi - not implemented yet
#

# install_dir is the directory where the software should be installed.
# This should be an absolute path.
# Uncomment & edit the line if you want to specify this; don't forget

# not "install_dir", it's "install_dir/python/lib/python".

# if not defined,  install_dir is defined by the install script essentially
# as os.getcwd() + "/webserver" at the time of running ./install from trunk
# Note that os.getcwd() is not valid in the later context of running the server
# so install_dir needs to be fixed at install time.

#
#
# If the install script has to create the config.py to use by copying
# this file ( config.dev.py ), it will set a default install_dir at
# the top of the file.  You can override it here, or do nothing to
# get the default.
