<p><b>Batch Submit References</b> supports uploading a list of reference
files for a single rmap,  e.g. ACS darkfile.   After checking and 
storing the reference files,   new CRDS mapping files which refer to them
are generated.

<p><p><b>Old Context to Derive From</b> The name of the pipeline context which 
will be recursively updated to insert the new reference files.

<p><p><b>Uploaded References</b> lets you upload references to CRDS.   Each 
reference file must certify or the entire batch will be rejected.
