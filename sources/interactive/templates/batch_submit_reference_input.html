<p><b>Batch Submit References</b> supports uploading a list of reference
files for a single rmap,  e.g. ACS darkfile.   After checking and 
storing the reference files,   the implied reference mapping is updated by
adding or replacing lines for the uploaded reference files.   New instrument
and pipeline mappings are then generated.

<p><p><b>Uploaded References</b> lets you upload references to CRDS.   Each 
reference file must certify or the entire batch will be rejected.
