<p><b>Batch Submit References</b> supports uploading a list of reference
files for one or more reference types of a single instrument.  After checking and 
storing the reference files,   new CRDS rmap files which refer to them
are generated.  Finally a new imap and pmap are generated to refer to the new rmaps.
Each reference file must certify or the entire batch will be rejected.  

{% include "select_files_help.html" %}

<p><p><b>Derive From Context</b> The name of the pipeline context which 
will be recursively updated to insert the new reference files.

<p><p><b>Change Level</b> The degree to which the new files are expected to 
impact science results.

<p><p><b>Creator</b> author of the contents or changes to the file,  not 
necessarily the submitter.   The submitter is known based on login information.

<p><p><b>Description</b> information about what's new in this file and what
the expected impacts are.

{% include "auto_rename_help.html" %}

<p><p><b>Compare Old Reference</b> check this to perform table comparisons
against prior versions of the submitted reference file.  The prior reference
file is located by inspecting the derivation context.  Left unchecked,  
no comparison to prior versions is performed.
