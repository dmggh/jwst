<p><p><b>Auto Rename</b> when checked, the uploaded file will be renamed to a 
unique name using CRDS naming conventions and id numbers,  e.g.
's7g1700gm_dead.fits' might be renamed as ' hst_cos_deadtab_0002.fits'.  
Auto-renaming will be the default (the option will be removed) once CRDS
enters a more operational phase.   For side-by-side testing with CDBS,  leaving
auto-renaming unchecked makes reference file changes more traceable between
the two systems.
