<p><p><b>Auto Rename</b> when checked, the uploaded file will be renamed to a 
unique name using CRDS naming conventions and id numbers,  e.g.
's7g1700gm_dead.fits' might be renamed as ' hst_cos_deadtab_0002.fits'.  In general 
auto-renaming should be left checked and CRDS names assigned;  this feature is
useful for delivery of test files and for side-by-side testing with CDBS where
filename equality is required for easy comparison.
