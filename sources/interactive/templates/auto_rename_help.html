<p><p><b>Auto Rename</b> when checked, the uploaded file will be renamed to a 
unique name using CRDS naming conventions and id numbers,  e.g.
's7g1700gm_dead.fits' might be renamed as ' hst_cos_deadtab_0002.fits'.
Left unchecked, this option enables easy comparisons with CDBS names during side-by-side
testing with CRDS.   Once CRDS is operational as the prime system Auto Rename should 
be checked so that CRDS-style names are assigned.
