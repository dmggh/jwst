in this context with the same parameters for the sake of comparison.

<p><p><b>Compare Old Reference</b> check this to perform table comparisons
against prior versions of the submitted reference file identified by the
comparison context.  If left unchecked,  the comparison context is ignored
and no comparison to prior versions is performed.
