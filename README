This directory contains the files associated with a Django web server
/ project organized in the standard fashion.  It is installed as the
crds.server package with a crds.server.lookup Django site.  The
nominal purpose of this code is to support services supplied by an
HTTP server at STScI and hence the code is not intended for
distribution in the same manner as the CRDS core library.  Presently
it has only been configured for and tested with Django's dev server,
not Apache/mod_wsgi/mod_python.

Running the test server requires an independent installation of the CRDS
library:

% svn co https://subversion.assembla.com/svn/crds/trunk  CRDS
% cd CRDS
% ./install

The CRDS server package can be installed like this:

% svn co https://subversion.assembla.com/svn/crds_server/trunk CRDS_server
% cd CRDS_server
% python setup.py install

NOTE: the crds.server package installs as crds/server not crds_server
as you might expect from the subversion.  The source code for
crds.server is kept separate from the rest of the crds package to keep
it private to STScI.

The development server is run like this:

% cd CRDS_server
% python manage.py runserver
Validating models...
0 errors found

Django version 1.2.4, using settings 'CRDS_server.settings'
Development server is running at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
Quit the server with CONTROL-C.

For now,  the best reference service demo script can be run like this:

% cd CRDS_server
% python test_service.py `cat ../CRDS/hst/gentools/files_acs_warren`

test_service is written to operate on a list of relative filepaths and
FITS headers which are already known and cached by the
crds.hst.gentools package.  The upside of this arrangement is that the
demo can be run without gigabytes of test datasets and without half a
terabyte of reference files.  The downside is that the caches have to
be updated by someone with access to any extra datasets and reference
files if additional tests are required.  This demo is not for testing
for testing web features, in particular the lookup service, not for
testing CRDS answers.
