1. General server setup flow is:

# Install the code as indicated by the appropriate config file from
# sources/configs/config.<observatory>.<server_kind>
./install [hst|jwst]  [dev|test|prod]

NOTE:  this will likely fail due to missing Python packages installed 
by init_pkgs.  If so,  it should fail *after* env.csh is created.  At
that point,  init_pkgs can be run.   After running init_pkgs,  re-run
install to complete without errors.

# Install third party database components, pyodbc and unixODBC/FreeTDS stack,
# as well as additional django applications.

./init_pkgs [hst|jwst] [dev|test|prod]

# Possibly re-run install if the first run failed due to missing packages
./install [hst|jwst]  [dev|test|prod]

# Initilize the CRDS catalog with existing reference files, deliver initial
# set of mappings.
# Enter system passwords.
./init [hst|jwst] [dev|test|prod]
<enter password for test user>

2. Procedure for starting the sever:

% ./run

3. Procedure for update not affecting the database:

% ./rerun [hst|jwst] [dev|test|prod]

4. Procedure for running a command line / ipython environment for debug

% ./shell

5. Procedure for running HST server self-tests.

% ./run hst dev
% ./runtest hst dev   (2nd terminal)

or 

6. Procedure for running Django management commands

% ./manage <additional parameters to django-admin.py>

e.g.


7. Database commands

% ./manage dbshell  # to open a SQL prompt to the CRDS server database

% ./manage dbbackup  # to create a django-dbbackup server database backup
% ./manage dbrestore <backup file>   # to revert to an older version of the database
