# This is the command line I use to initialize a developer database for the
# first time.  It creates database blobs for every file under the closure of
# hst.pmap,  references as well as mappings.   By default, potentially slow or
# non-essential stuff (sha1sum, instrument, filekind, serial) is not added by
# the trailing "0" flag.  Switch to "1" to add those.
