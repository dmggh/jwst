The crds_report package is used to automatically generate CRDS reports based
on:

   CRDS Code Development Project Jira Tickets
   HST + JWST Operational + Edit CRDS Contexts
   HST + JWST OPS + TEST File Deliveries

Reports are generated automatically on a weekly and monthly basis.

Additional reports exist for checking developer status on report days or
overall closed tickets for JWST DMS Software Delivery Notice reporting.
