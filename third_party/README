This directory contains C libraries and Python packages which augment
the CRDS webserver environment.

The script "meta" is a generic installer used here to set up:

freetds
unixODBC
pyodbc

other non-standard packages

Within "meta":

a .meta file is a .tar file which includes build and install scripts.

a .pygz file is a .tar.gz file which contains a standard Python source tree
usable by setup.py.

a .tar.gz file is a standard UNIX tarball which is built using configure.

The module argparse.py is included here because it isn't included in
Python-2.6 and hence isn't in OS-X 10.6.8 Snow Leopard.
