This directory contains library code and a Python package for
supporting standard SQL database operations.  This enables the CRDS server
to obtain dataset headers for the purpose of computing best references
based on dataset id.

The script "meta" is a generic installer used here to set up:

freetds
unixODBC
pyodbc

Within "meta":

a .meta file is a .tar file which includes build and install scripts.

a .pygz file is a .tar.gz file which contains a standard Python source tree
usable by setup.py.

a .tar.gz file is a standard UNIX tarball which is built using configure.

The module argparse.py is included here because it isn't included in
Python-2.6 and hence isn't in OS-X 10.6.8 Snow Leopard.
