Sometimes the database tables need to be recreated to add or drop model fields.

Untried method is:

python manage.py reset app_name

which should drop and recreate tables for an application,  e.g. "interactive"


The proven tedious method is, in CRDS_server,  do:

./manage dbshell
sql> show tables

then e.g.:

sql>  drop table crds_jwst_counters;

there are about 10 interdepedent tables so it takes a while.   

Delete child tables before parent tables.
