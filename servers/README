The apache config file is created by catting together these files in
this order, then editing various SUB_ values to insert config items.

servers/httpd.mod_python.conf
	basic config

servers/apache_dso.$dso_version
	list of LoadModule commands - dso_version is 2.2 for RHE 5

servers/httpd.add_ldap
	only if the config file asks for authentication - probably
	will be obsolete soon

one of:
	servers/httpd.redirect_debug
	servers/httpd.redirect_nodebug
		create redirects from / to get you to the app


Values that are substituted in the created config file are:

SUB_APACHEMOD
	directory to load apache modules that we compile 

SUB_DIR
	install directory

SUB_PORT
	port number to listen on

SUB_CDBS
	value for PYSYN_CDBS
