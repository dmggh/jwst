Hi Everyone,

I’ve attached 8 procedures for review by development that cover 10 CRDS requirements for DMS Build 5.

Test procedure to requirement mapping:
dms-tp-433 —> DMS-542
dms-tp-431 —> DMS-546 & DMS-680
dms-tp-441 —> DMS-547
dms-tp-413 —> DMS-548
dms-tp-411 —> DMS-669
dms-tp-434 —> DMS-681
dms-tp-436 —> DMS-682
dms-tp-440 —> DMS-685 & DMS-686

If these procedures could be reviewed by March 8th, 2016, that would be preferable. However, I realize a large dump of procedures like this may take longer to review.

Thank you,
