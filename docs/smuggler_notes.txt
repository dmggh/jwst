The Django-smuggler package can be used to download JSON serialized copies
of server application models.   There is a "dump" URL and a "load" URL pattern.

Access link:  
       
       https://jwst-crds.stsci.edu/admin/auth/dump

to download the auth application database models.

Access the link:

       https://jwst-crds.stsci.edu/admin/auth/load

to upload .json from a prior download.

This process can be used to transfer models from one server, say OPS,  to
another,  say TEST, without going through the full mirroring process,
synchronizing caches and directories, etc.

NOTE that Django smuggler can be used on any app but that there's an assumption
that the models between the source and destination systems are the same, not
different versions of the same model as might happen during server development.
